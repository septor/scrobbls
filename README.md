# SCROBBLS

An extensive Last.fm display plugin.

If you can view it on Last.fm, and it's accessible in the API, you'll be able to display it on your website.

## Planned Outputs

* Menus
  * Top 10 - artists, albums, tracks
  * Recent Tracks - list and tagcloudesque
* Pages
  * Charts

.. more? Let me know!

## Hey, you're missing something I want to use!

I've omitted some things from the API in the Scrobbls class. If you need it, let me know and I'll add it in. You can also submit a pull request with your additions if you want it done quicker.

### :godmode:

I'll add more to this as time goes on and as the plugin nears a beta release!
